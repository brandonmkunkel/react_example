# Example React Project

## About

I am using this project as an example for practicing React

## Getting started

1. Install Docker

## Infrastructure

This repo uses the suggested configuration from [this blog post](https://mherman.org/blog/dockerizing-a-react-app/)

This project is treated like a containerized deployment, but is really just used for creating a static example page
